## London Travel Status App

A simple React Redux application that pulls London Underground, Overground, DLR and Tram data off of TfL's API and displays it.

### Prerequisites
Before starting the application, you must have a [TfL API account](https://api.tfl.gov.uk) with your own app_id and app_key. Put in your personal credentials in src/apis/tfl.js within the corresponding variables. <br>
<br>
In the project directory, you can run:

### Running the application
### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
